IMAGES: CC0 and CC-Non-Commercial-3
Simple svg shapes and charges are self-made and available under CC0. Complex charges are historical, svg renders are coming from WappenWiki and available for non-commercial use under CC3. Source info is added to svg files as a comment. All images are manually optimized by me.
