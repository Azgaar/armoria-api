# filewatcher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/filewatcher.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/filewatcher)

Simple wrapper around `fs.watch` that works around the [various issues](https://github.com/joyent/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
you have to deal with when using the Node API directly.

More precisely filewatcher â€¦
* always reports file names (for all events on all OSes)
* works well with editors that perform atomic writes (save & rename) like Sublime Text or vim
* doesn't fire twice when files are saved
* falls back to `fs.watchFile` when running out of file handles
* has no native dependencies
* uses Node's async APIs under the hood

This module is used by [node-dev](https://npmjs.org/package/node-dev)
and [instant](https://npmjs.org/package/instant).

### Usage

```js
var filewatcher = require('filewatcher');

var watcher = filewatcher();

// watch a file
watcher.add(__filename);

// ... or a directory
watcher.add(__dirname);

watcher.on('change', function(file, stat) {
  console.log('File modified: %s', file);
  if (!stat) console.log('deleted');
});
```

To stop watching, you can remove either a single file or all watched files at once:
```js
watcher.remove(file)
watcher.removeAll()
```

#### Notify users when falling back to polling

When the process runs out of file handles, _filewatcher_ closes all watchers and transparently switches to `fs.watchFile` polling. You can notify your users by listening to the `fallback` event:

```js
watcher.on('fallback', function(limit) {
  console.log('Ran out of file handles after watching %s files.', limit);
  console.log('Falling back to polling which uses more CPU.');
  console.log('Run ulimit -n 10000 to increase the limit for open files.');
});
```

### Options

You can pass options to `filewatcher()` in order to tweak its internal settings. These are the defaults:

```js
// the default options
var opts = {
  forcePolling: false,  // try event-based watching first
  debounce: 10,         // debounce events in non-polling mode by 10ms
  interval: 1000,       // if we need to poll, do it every 1000ms
  persistent: true      // don't end the process while files are watched
};

var watcher = filewatcher(opts)
```
